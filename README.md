# Tip Data Analysis with Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor

## This project aims to analyze the tip data using Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor models. 

#### The dataset contains various types of data, including numerical and categorical features. The workflow of the project involves data preprocessing, training the models, evaluating feature importances, and making predictions.

#### Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing: In this step, the raw data is prepared for analysis by handling missing values and converting text columns to numerical columns using encoding techniques.

  + Missing Values Handling: Any missing values in the dataset are identified and addressed using appropriate methods, such as imputation or removal.

  + Text Columns to Numerical Columns: Categorical columns in the dataset are converted to numerical representation to be used in the models. Two common encoding techniques, OrdinalEncoder and OneHotEncoder, can be applied depending on the nature of the categorical variables.

2. Train Model: After preprocessing the data, the Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor models are trained using the prepared dataset.

  + Decision Tree Regressor: A Decision Tree Regressor model is trained using the preprocessed data. The model learns to make predictions based on the features and target variable (tip).

  + Random Forest Regressor: A Random Forest Regressor model is trained using the preprocessed data. The model consists of an ensemble of decision trees and predicts the target variable by averaging the predictions of individual trees.

3. Evaluate Feature Importances: The feature importances of the trained models are evaluated to understand the contribution of each feature in predicting the tip.

  + Total Error Reduction: The feature importances are calculated based on the total error reduction brought by each feature. This helps in identifying the most influential features in predicting the tip.

4. Prediction: Finally, the trained models are used to make predictions on new or unseen data.

#### Conclusion
By using Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor models, this project managed to analyze the tip data and provide insights into the significant features affecting the tip amount which helps making predictions on new data using the trained models.
